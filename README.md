# Analog-to-Digital-Digital-to-Analog-Converter

Deployed Analog-to-Digital and Digital-to-Analog Converters on Microchipâ€™s PIC16F1517 programmable IC. The A-DC program repetitively performed conversions and displayed the binary result to 10 LEDs connected to output pins. I utilized my knowledge of microcontroller registers to configure ADCON0 and ADCON1, setting the 10-bit output to right-justified and assigning the least and most significant bits to specific pins. The D-AC was assembled using a R/2R resistive latter network. Using a counter C program and an oscilloscope to test my D-AC program, the results were a voltage ladder in the oscilloscope with a step value of .0196 Volts, hence creating a smooth ramp of 256 steps.
