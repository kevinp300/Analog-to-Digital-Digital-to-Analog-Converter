# Analog-to-Digital-Digital-to-Analog-Converter

A C program was developed to control a Permanent Magnet DC motor using a PIC16F1517 programmable microcontroller. The program was designed to switch the motor on and off with 2 second intervals, set the motor to half speed at 1 kHz or turn on or off. This project required the knowledge and application of system level and architecture design of embedded systems, state machine programming, and digital signal processing. To test the design, an oscilloscope was used to measure and analyze the output signals and ensure that the program was functioning as intended. This project allowed for the development of skills in programming for microcontrollers and the implementation of digital signal processing techniques for motor control.
